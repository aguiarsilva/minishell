cat<input does not behave like bash not broken
export my_var="test" broken
cat = "input.txt" has '=' as argument for cat but proceeds otherwise normaly
export =       with no input, should give error msg

after cat ctrl \ should quit
cat << EOF ctrl d should do nothing
cat execute then ctrl \ should exit
env should not printf  keys with an empty value
if cmd fails and then try redirect it prints to stdout example ls non_existent_file 2> errorfile
| grep "text" has no error message or anything? // not really need to fix, breaks nothing

unset HOME should really unset then cd should fail
./minishell should limit itself to max 1000

echo hellofgsyjvsedjvfsdejvgsdejvfcjsdvfcjsdev | cat >  pipedreams.txt
ls -a | wc -c | cat | ls -a > file1 does pipe and stdout at the same time, not gonna fix
ls -la | grep "test" | sort | uniq | tee file1 | wc -l > file2 | cat > file3 files piping to last file
ls -la >file1>file2>file3 only works when there a spaces between file
ls -l | grep utils > output.xt does not pipe filerted output to output.txt
