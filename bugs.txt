echo "<< EOF" gets detected as Heredoc

cat<input does not behave like bash not broken
export my_var="test" broken
cat = "input.txt" has '=' as argument for cat but proceeds otherwise normaly

echo '$USER' still expands
echo '> >> < * ? [ ] | ; [ ] || && ( ) & # $  <<' heredoc opens and everzthing breaks
export =       with no input, should give error msg
echo is bugged when print to a file
cat < input.txt | wc -l > output.txt is broken now
