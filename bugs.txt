cat<input does not behave like bash not broken
export my_var="test" broken
cat = "input.txt" has '=' as argument for cat but proceeds otherwise normaly
echo '$USER' still expands
export =       with no input, should give error msg
if you unset EC and then exit program crashes
prompt can be full with character no new line added?
echo << EOF crashes the program

echo hola""""""""""""echo hola""""""""""""

$> causes memory leak
exit $HOME causes meme leak
after cat ctrl \ should quit
cat << EOF ctrl d should do nothing
cat execute then ctrl \ should exit
env should not printf  keys with an empty value
if cmd fails and then try redirect it prints to stdout example ls non_existent_file 2> errorfile
| grep "text" has no error message or antthing?
